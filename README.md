### vector_sorting

Here I use the ndarray object from the NumPy module for vector manipulation. As of now, it generates any number of n-dimensional vectors and can sort them by magnitude. 
Moving forward though, I'd like to add normalization, complex inverse vectors with graphic visualization, and reductions for linear independence when using integer coordinates.

If NumPy isn't installed (included in the SciPy library):
```
pip install numpy
```

**Run VectorSorter.py**
